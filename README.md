# BlackBoxDuty

### Cloud flight recorder for GuardDuty

BlackBoxDuty keeps your GuardDuty findings from disappearing after 90 days. Designed for security teams, researchers, and auditors, it captures findings in real time and stores them durably for long-term analysis. Simple to deploy, extend, and integrate—BlackBoxDuty ensures your threat data stays yours, for as long as you need it.

BlackBuxDuty is built with [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) as a workflow, also called State machines. To deploy the State Machine follow the instruction in [README.md](/blackboxduty/README.md).
